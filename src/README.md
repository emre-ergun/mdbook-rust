# Introduction

## Purpose

This site is a collection of my personal Rust notes. I made it to help me understand Rust better and to have a quick place to review important topics. It also works as a learning guide for others who want to learn Rust. The book covers basic to advanced topics with short explanations and examples that are easy to follow.

## Motivation

While I was learning Rust, I wrote down useful tips and examples. Later, I thought it could also help other developers. Rust has some hard parts like ownership and lifetimes, and I wanted to make those easier to understand. Writing this book also helped me remember what I learned.

## Todos

Here are some things I plan to add:

- Add more real-world examples, especially in advanced topics like concurrency and unsafe Rust
- Share more common Rust patterns and best practices in the appendix
- Add diagrams to explain difficult ideas like ownership and traits
- Keep the content up to date with the newest Rust versions
